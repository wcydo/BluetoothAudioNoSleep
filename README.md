# BluetoothAudioNoSleep
Some audio Bluetooth devices go into Low Power Mode when there's no audio stream for 20 seconds. This prevents that from happening. The annoyance is when you don't play audio for a few seconds then play something only to sit there waiting for the audio stream to start. Beyond frustrating.

# How-to
Compile and run the executable as Admin if you wish to have it hidden from taskbar. You'll hear a beep "click" sound and you'll be like wtf how's that fixing my problem. Just go to Volume Mixer and mute the program from there.

# Start-up
You can also add the program to Startup, I added it to shell:startup (use Run). 

# Improvements
One may do better than this, and you're free to do so. This works just fine for me so I don't need to touch it again.
